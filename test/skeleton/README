To create your own unit test suite:

1. run the 'make_test_folder.sh' script from the /test directory
to build a new test folder. Pass the name of the folder you wish
to create as a command line argument to the script.

2. Add tests cases to the *_client_impl.cpp file in you new folder.

3. Add the  implementation of the functions you wish to test to 
   *_server_impl.cpp. 

4. Define your program interface within the .erpc file using 
Freescale's eRPC IDL language.

5. Add the service created by your IDL file to the add_services()
function in server_unit_test.cpp

6. Run the binaries you created! They reside in 
    /erpc/Debug/$(OS)/Test/$(your_test_name)/erpc_test_client/
    and
    /erpc/Debug/$(OS)/Test/$(your_test_name)/erpc_test_server/
    and can be run with 'make run-ut-[client|server]'
    from within your unit test directory.

*NOTE: the makefiles are set up to handle an IDL file with named 
 $TEST_FOLDER.erpc, where $TEST_FOLDER is the name of the folder 
in which the erpc file resides. If you wish to include other IDL's
use the import statement in the $TEST_FOLDER.erpc file.
